# Landing-Page

This is a repository with my first landing page. It is built using HTMl, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.

You can find the deployed version on heroku<a href="https://quiet-everglades-41816.herokuapp.com/"> here.</a>


**Next Steps**
<li>Customize the landing page so, it will look less plain</li>
